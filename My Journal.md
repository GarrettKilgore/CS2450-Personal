Today I got office hours help because I was struggling with understanding how to use the Linux Subsystem. I went and got help for this course
and C++ to understand the use for this terminal and I can now safely say I have a great understanding of how this subsystem now works. I wrote
down all of the commands I will be using in these 2 courses and noted what each one does. I have managed to push everything to GitHub and I'm
all caught up. I cannot wait to see what this course has to offer now!

Today we finsihed our Requirements Document in class listing out all of the features and ideas we want to impliment into our group project.
I offered to create the website layout because this is something I'm very knowledgeable at, as I have a degree in this field. I'm
hoping I can put a bunch of extra effort into our project to really make it stand out. There are also a few features I'm going to attempt
to add that I haven't tried coding from scratch before. One of those features is a full on login system. I usually have plug-ings that do
that work for me. Hopefully this will go well.

We met in a group chat and created some diagrams for our site. 3 of us designed flow diagrams based on what users will be able to do on our
site and what world leaders will be able to do. I also created a seperate diagram on how users will be able to create and edit their profiles. As
for the component diagram, we created a diagram on all of the different features we want to have in our database. It's a big mess of features right
now, but we plan on fleshing it out in the future. As for now, our vision is huge, but when we move onto the implimentation aspect of this project,
I'm sure we might have to scale some things down or make some changes, but for now we have a clear goal as to what we want to do.

We met as a group in one of those booths in the Computer Science building to draw out some diagrams of what we want our site to look like and
what we want to have in our database. This database is one of the biggest, most complex, databases I've ever tried to build and work with. It's
going to be a real challenge to get this to work. Once we had our ideas settled for building the database, we then focused on the site's front end.
I drew a few concepts on what I wanted it to look like and we all voted on which one would be best. The layout we are going to go with is a
slight modiciation of what Twitter's layout is. We plan on adding a few features such as having an area for the site admin's favorites
so that users can learn more about who is in charge of the website. I do think I can recreate the concept I drew up. I love adding animations
to sites to make them look a bit nicer, so I might do that as well. Even though our site can be looked at as a joke, I really want to make it 
look professional and realistic.
