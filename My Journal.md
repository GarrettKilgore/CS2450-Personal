Today I got office hours help because I was struggling with understanding how to use the Linux Subsystem. I went and got help for this course
and C++ to understand the use for this terminal and I can now safely say I have a great understanding of how this subsystem now works. I wrote
down all of the commands I will be using in these 2 courses and noted what each one does. I have managed to push everything to GitHub and I'm
all caught up. I cannot wait to see what this course has to offer now!

Today we finsihed our Requirements Document in class listing out all of the features and ideas we want to impliment into our group project.
I offered to create the website layout because this is something I'm very knowledgeable at, as I have a degree in this field. I'm
hoping I can put a bunch of extra effort into our project to really make it stand out. There are also a few features I'm going to attempt
to add that I haven't tried coding from scratch before. One of those features is a full on login system. I usually have plug-ings that do
that work for me. Hopefully this will go well.
