My Journal

It's my first week in class! I wasn't sure what to expect going into this course specifically because the name of this course is just called "Intro to Software Engineering" but I'm starting to see what it's about. It looks like it's going to use a structure that is similar to working in this field at a real company. I like that setup. I wish more classes would do this. I can't wait to learn more and work with a group in this course! I think this will be my most fun course.

We learned how to get and turn in assignments today. It looks like we are going to be using a Linux subsystem and I'm not looking forward to that. I've had to use this in one course before in the past and I was never told exactly what the point of it is or why it's even necessary. I might have to get some help because I was never told how this thing properly works. The first course I had that used it just treated it as if I already knew what it was and how to use it.

Today I got office hours help because I was struggling with understanding how to use the Linux Subsystem. I went and got help for this course and C++ to understand the use for this terminal and I can now safely say I have a great understanding of how this subsystem now works. I wrote down all of the commands I will be using in these 2 courses and noted what each one does. I have managed to push everything to GitHub and I'm all caught up. I cannot wait to see what this course has to offer now!

Today we finished our Requirements Document in class listing out all of the features and ideas we want to implement into our group project. I offered to create the website layout because this is something I'm very knowledgeable at, as I have a degree in this field. I'm hoping I can put a bunch of extra effort into our project to really make it stand out. There are also a few features I'm going to attempt to add that I haven't tried coding from scratch before. One of those features is a full on login system. I usually have plug-ins that do that work for me. Hopefully this will go well.

We met in a group chat and created some diagrams for our site. 3 of us designed flow diagrams based on what users will be able to do on our site and what world leaders will be able to do. I also created a separate diagram on how users will be able to create and edit their profiles. As for the component diagram, we created a diagram on all of the different features we want to have in our database. It's a big mess of features right now, but we plan on fleshing it out in the future. As for now, our vision is huge, but when we move onto the implementation aspect of this project, I'm sure we might have to scale some things down or make some changes, but for now we have a clear goal as to what we want to do.

We met as a group in one of those booths in the Computer Science building to draw out some diagrams of what we want our site to look like and what we want to have in our database. This database is one of the biggest, most complex, databases I've ever tried to build and work with. It's going to be a real challenge to get this to work. Once we had our ideas settled for building the database, we then focused on the site's front end. I drew a few concepts on what I wanted it to look like and we all voted on which one would be best. The layout we are going to go with is a slight modification of what Twitter's layout is. We plan on adding a few features such as having an area for the site admin's favorites so that users can learn more about who is in charge of the website. I do think I can recreate the concept I drew up. I love adding animations to sites to make them look a bit nicer, so I might do that as well. Even though our site can be looked at as a joke, I really want to make it look professional and realistic.

We started getting our slides together ready to present next week. We are deciding on who is going to say what. I'm going to go with the features and some of the database because I did write out how it's going to work. So I figure that it just makes sense for me to talk about my vision for this project. I've taken plenty of speech classes in the past so I think I'll be able to discuss everything just fine and if our presentation needs to be any longer, I think I can manage talking about these features for a long period of time.

We presented today. I think it went a lot better than I was expecting. I actually enjoyed talking about my vision for this project and went on and on about some of the funny features we plan on adding. It kind of makes me want to do something like this again. The goal from now is just seeing if we can actually put it all together. Like I said in the speech, this is the most ambitious database I've ever tried to assemble. I'll just try to take it in pieces and not all at once to avoid overwhelming myself. I think we got this.

We have started coding out our site. Rylynn has been a huge help with getting this database sorted out. I've started putting together the overall design of the site and once I'm satisfied with a basic form of it, I'll start to work on the functionality of it and we can start to connect all of our files together. It's a start but there is still plenty of more to do. Plus we need to get the rest of the group on the same page as the 2 of us. Once we get all 5 of us on board and they all know what to do, I feel like this will be a bit easier. We shall see though. I'm just picturing several moments in the future where we will run into hurdles that we cannot jump over. I shouldn't worry about that now. I should just focus on doing my part for now.

We have started getting the structure of the site laid out. It doesn't have a specific theme just yet but the important part is just to have something that functions first. This database still feels ambisuious however Rylynn is committed to getting this thing up and running. It might take most of our time to get this working.

Spring Break

Our Login Page now works! This is such a relief to see even though this is something so small, it's a relief knowing that the database is starting to work! Users can create an account and sign in with that newly created account. From here we are now going to work on adding in the functionality of the feed page. There is going to be a lot there. We are planning on adding a friend's list, allowing for the user to make posts, the ability to delete posts, upload images and videos, and more if there is enough time. I'm starting to feel good about this

I've started trying to make the site look nice. The CSS is a big mess and I'm having a hard time understanding how the style works on this page. What I might have to do is create a new CSS file and override everythihg that I want to make a change to. Doing this would take way longer than normal so I'm still trying to find solutions. We are still trying to get the database on the feed page to work. We need some more time.

Most of the database is working now. Users can make posts however pics and videos do not work. We are currently working on getting the friend's list to work next. This database is slowly but surely coming together. I've also learned how to override and make some changes to the CSS. It's been a challenge finding all of the classes that everything is assigned to. I've had to inspect just about everything to get it to change. Because of this, it has been a slow process to get done, but the good news is that I don't have to do this all in a few days. I have time to slowly design an build this site out.

Users can now friend others in our database. Most of this database is using flask and it's a thing of beauty. Since this is a parody of MySpace, I've taken the colors of MySpace and have added them to our site. Our theme is going to be the same colors that MySpace uses. I'm working on mixing them together to make them look nice. That has been a little bit of a challenge.

We have finally got photos and videos working on our site. Users can now upload them and add them to their posts. However for some strange reason, it doesn't work on my laptop. I'm not sure why, but it is working on everyone else's despite me being the one who added it in. I'm not sure why that's happening. I'll have to dig through every change I made to see if I accidentally deleted something. In the meantime I'm also adding the final touches to the CSS. Unfortunately, we had to remove some features we were planning on adding because of how detailed we made this database. I'm proud that we actually got this huge database working, but I still wish we could have done more functionality wise.

This is presenting day! I was able to fix several issues with our site. The images and videos that users were uploading did not fit on the site so I managed to get that fixed at the last minute. We got everything done that we could do. The database fully works, I got the site to look nice and not some Ai template webpage, and our slideshow is good to go. I can't wait to talk and show it off to everyone. I am pretty proud of it! This was a fun semester and I hope I'll have another one just like this one again!
