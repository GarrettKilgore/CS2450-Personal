Today I got office hours help because I was struggling with understanding how to use the Linux Subsystem. I went and got help for this course
and C++ to understand the use for this terminal and I can now safely say I have a great understanding of how this subsystem now works. I wrote
down all of the commands I will be using in these 2 courses and noted what each one does. I have managed to push everything to GitHub and I'm
all caught up. I cannot wait to see what this course has to offer now!
